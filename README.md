# Servless-media-convert-and-delievery
This Serverless Soultion is about providing encoded videos for different formats from a single source file
Scenario:
We need to build a solution for customer where they can display their videos with the ability of downloading that videos into different formats. So, users are able to watch these videos on their compatible devices in terms of video format (resolution, source media, internet speed etc.). Users also should be able to express their thoughts about video by liking or disliking the video.
We need to build this solution serverless and auto scalable as much as possible and automate the deploying process. So, customer can use this by minimum efforts.
